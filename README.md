# About HEBui_v3.0

The **py3CSEP HEB** is the python implementation of the **3CSEP High Efficiency Buildings (HEB)** model developed by the [*Department of Environmental Sciences and Policy*](https://envsci.ceu.edu/) at [**CEU**](https://www.ceu.edu/) (Central European University).

This module (HEBui_v3.0) serves the access (and basic visualization) of the model data. It was developed by Benedek Kiss and Zoltán Hajnal in the framework of the EU-H2020 research project [SENTINEL](https://sentinel.energy/).

This software uses open-source packages.

# Documentation

Detailed description of the model can be found in the published research reports, the most essential ones also included in the [*`documentation`*](https://github.com/HEBv3/HEBui_v3/tree/main/documentation) folder.

## How to cite the HEB model

In derived works, please cite the HEB model as:

**Decarbonisation Pathways for Buildings**, *Souran Chatterjee, Benedek Kiss, Diana Ürge-Vorsatz & Sven Teske*, pp 161–185 in: Achieving the Paris Climate Agreement Goals Part 2 (ed. Sven Teske), DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-99177-7, [https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-99177-7](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-99177-7)


# Input data

The input data of the model (the buildings' categorization scheme, as well as preprocessed background data derived from several international statistical, economic, and demographic databases) can be found in the [*`input_data`*](https://github.com/HEBv3/HEBui_v3/tree/main/input_data) folder.

# Downloading HEBui

The HEBui package is made available via GitHub: [https://github.com/HEBv3/HEBui_v3](https://github.com/HEBv3/HEBui_v3).

To download the package, follow the above link, and in the upper right corner of the folder listing find the (green) **[<> Code]** button. Pressing it, you can select ***Download ZIP*** from the dropdown menu.

# Software requirements

- HEBui was written in *python*, thus some *python* distribution needs to be installed on a system to be able to run it.
- Also, some additional (open source) packages are used by the software, which are listed in the [*`requirements.txt`*](https://github.com/HEBv3/HEBui_v3/blob/main/HEBui/requirements.txt) file (in the *`HEBui`* folder).
- For the installation of the above, prior to running the *`HEBui`*, please refer to the documention of your *python* distribution & environment.

# Unpacking & Running HEBui

- Unpack the ZIP file contents to a folder of your choice (named *`[HEBmain]`* in the following)
- Open a terminal for command line access (on windows systems, e.g. *`cmd.exe`*)
- Navigate to the *`[HEBmain]/HEBui`* folder (on windows systems: *`[HEBmain]\HEBui`*)
- Run the following command: *`python hebui_v3_0.py`*
- The terminal shows basic messages of a local (minimal) *web-server* starting-up
- In a web-browser (like *Firefox*) open a new window/tab, and type in the address bar: *`localhost:8050`* -- with this, the greeting panel of pyHEB should open
- After finishing (closing the web-browser window/tab) the program can be interrupted/closed by pressing *`ctrl+C`* (or *`ctrl-BREAK`* on windows systems) in the terminal

# Output

After selecting the options for the scenarios (or just using the initial values) the *`Calculate`* tab  offers a **`[Calculation:]`** button. Pressing it prepares the model output in several data tables for the scenarios, that can be downloaded in *CSV* format for further analysis. The tables' header codes can be interpreted as follows:
